# Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator

[![Haskell-CI](https://github.com/haskell/alex/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell/alex/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml)

Alex is a tool for generating lexical analysers, also known as "lexers" and "scanners", in Haskell.
The lexical analysers implement a description of the tokens to be recognised in the form of regular expressions.
It is similar to the tools "lex" and "flex" for C/C++.
